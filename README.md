# time converter
A simple calculator for time conversions.

It sums all inputs (e.g. 1 year + 2 months + 44 hours + 99.88 seconds) and returns the result in each unit as well as a version with all units, only integers.

The number of decimal places in the results can be set in the Settings menu:

I wrote this program to teach myself more about programming in Python, specifically creating a GUI with `tkinter`.

I always struggle with time conversions myself, so I thought it would be neat to have this little calculator.
